# Azure-ServiceBus-DR

Azure CLI sample showing the process of leveraging Azure Service Bus Geo-disaster recovery

The guide script can be found here [service-bus-provisioning.sh](provisioning/service-bus-provisioning.sh)

This guid show the following:

1. Creating 2 new Service Bus namespaces in 2 different regions
2. Establish geo-pairing between the primary and secondary namespaces
3. Create various entities in the primary namespace (which will be replicated to the secondary namespace)
4. Fail over to secondary namespace
5. Create a new geo paired namespace (as the pairing to the old primary no long exists)
