## About the project

I tried to make sure I cover all aspects and best practices while building this project, but all included architecture, code, documentation and any other artifact represent my personal opinion only. Think of it as a suggestion of how a one way things can work.

Keep in mind that this is a work-in-progress, I will continue to contribute to it when I can.

All constructive feedback is welcomed üôè
